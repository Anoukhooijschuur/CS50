# CS50x

During summer 2015, I had the opportunity to follow the Harvard online course of Introduction to Compuer Science (CS50x), taught by David J. Malan.

During these 180 hours of courses, I have made different projects and you can find the source code here.

The following problem sets (pset) are currently online:

##pset1
A really simple problem set to learn the basic of coding and C.
###hello.c
The most simple program in the world that prints "Hello world!" to the console.
###mario.c

###greedy.c

##pset2
A problem set to understand ASCII math.
###initials.c
Really simple program that retreives the initials of a given name.
###caesar.c & viginiere.c
This is two cryptographic programs. Really fun to do (and to use!)

##pset3

###find.c
Simple program to find something in a given input. Practicing binary search.
###breakout.c
